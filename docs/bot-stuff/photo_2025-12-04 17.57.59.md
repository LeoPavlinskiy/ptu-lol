Got it — this graph contains **two straight-line curves**, so we can extract the data **analytically** (no special software needed).
I’ll reconstruct the data **as numerical values** based on the visible axis scales and endpoints.

# ✅ 1. **Extracted Endpoints (from the picture)**

### **Случай A (Case A)** — blue line

The blue line is perfectly straight from:

* **z = 0 m → Q ≈ +1.30×10⁶ N**
* **z = 17.5 m → Q = 0 N**

So Case A is a **linear decrease**.

---

### **Случай D (Case D)** — orange line

Similarly straight from:

* **z = 0 m → Q ≈ –0.50×10⁶ N**
* **z = 17.5 m → Q ≈ –0.10×10⁶ N**

So Case D is a **linear increase**.

# ✅ 2. **Linear Equations for Each Curve**

### **Case A**

We know two points:
[
(0,\ 1.30\times10^6),\quad (17.5,\ 0)
]

Slope:
[
k_A = \frac{0 - 1.30\times10^6}{17.5} = -74285.7 \text{ N/m}
]

Equation:
[
Q_A(z) = 1.30\times10^6 - 74285.7, z
]

---

### **Case D**

Two points:
[
(0,\ -0.50\times10^6),\quad (17.5,\ -0.10\times10^6)
]

Slope:
[
k_D = \frac{-0.10\times10^6 + 0.50\times10^6}{17.5}
= 22857.1 \text{ N/m}
]

Equation:
[
Q_D(z) = -0.50\times10^6 + 22857.1, z
]

| 5     | 929,000   |
| 7.5   | 743,000   |
| 10    | 557,000   |
| 12.5  | 371,000   |
| 15    | 186,000   |
| 17.5  | 0         |

### **Case D (orange)**

| z (m) | Q_D (N)  |
| ----- | -------- |
| 0     | –500,000 |
| 2.5   | –443,000 |
| 5     | –386,000 |
| 7.5   | –329,000 |
| 10    | –271,000 |
| 12.5  | –214,000 |
| 15    | –157,000 |
| 17.5  | –100,000 |

# ✅ If you want, I can also:

✔ produce the data in **CSV**
✔ create a clean **Excel file**
✔ generate a **high-accuracy digitization** using algorithmic methods
✔ reconstruct the **plot in Python or MATLAB**

Would you like the results exported as CSV, Excel, or something else?
